# Advanced Digital Logic Design FPGA Autonomous Robot

Under the instruction of our professor, the students in this class built our own small robots controlled by an Altera Max II FPGA. My robot integrates 5 IR transmitter and receiver pairs for sensing walls, a hall-effect sensor, a CDS cell, two DC motors controlled by an H Bridge, and various other user I/O devices to achieve the end goal of autonomously navigating through an obstable course. I configured my FPGA in Quartus 8.1 using VHDL, block diagrams, and finite state machines.
